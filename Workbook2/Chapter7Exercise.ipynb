THE SOFTWARE SERVES AS THE BACKBONE OF THRIPE'S OPERATIONS, EMPOWERING FARMERS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH A USER-FRIENDLY PLATFORM TO SHOWCASE THEIR PRODUCE, MANAGE INVENTORY, AND DIRECTLY ENGAGE WITH CONSUMERS.

THRIPE PROMOTES CONFIDENCE AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE AGRICULTURAL MARKET BY OFFERING CLEAR INFORMATION ABOUT PRODUCT ORIGINS AND FARMING PRACTICES, ALONG WITH REAL-TIME UPDATES ON DELIVERY STATUS. MOREOVER, THRIPE PRIORITIZES ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY BY OPTIMIZING OPERATIONS AND REDUCING FOOD WASTE THROUGH EFFICIENT LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT.\n","THE INCORPORATION OF CUTTING-EDGE SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS UNDERSCORES THRIPE'S COMMITMENT TO TRANSFORMING THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. BY LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO CONNECT CONSUMERS WITH HIGH-QUALITY, FRESH FOOD OPTIONS WHILE EMPOWERING FARMERS AND PROMOTING ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP.\n","\n","OBJECTIVES\n","OUR GOALS FOR THRIPE ARE CAREFULLY DESIGNED TO TARGET CERTAIN PROBLEMS IN THE AGRICULTURAL ECOLOGY. FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE WANT TO GIVE FARMERS MORE POWER BY GIVING THEM A STRONG PLATFORM TO DIRECTLY MARKET AND SELL THEIR PRODUCE, GIVING THEM MORE INDEPENDENCE AND CONTROL OVER THEIR FINANCIAL FUTURES. AT THE SAME TIME, WE WORK TO IMPROVE FOOD ACCESSIBILITY BY CURATING AN EXTENSIVE ASSORTMENT OF HIGH-QUALITY, LOCALLY SOURCED PRODUCTS, THIS ENCOURAGES HEALTHIER DIETARY CHOICES AND SUPPORTS THE COMMUNITY'S WELL-BEING. OUR PLATFORM IS BUILT ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF TRANSPARENCY AND TRUST. TO THAT AIM, WE PROMISE TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT EACH PRODUCT'S SOURCE AND AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES, ENCOURAGING A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND ESTABLISHING ENDURING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN FARMERS AND CONSUMERS.\n","\n","CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK (IPO MODEL)\n","INPUT\n","DETAILS FROM FARMERS REGARDING THE KINDS OF CROPS THEY GROW, THE AMOUNT THAT IS AVAILABLE, AND THE COST.

THE SOFTWARE OFFERS A SMOOTH INTERFACE FOR QUESTIONS, ORDER UPDATES, AND COMMENTS, FACILITATING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN FARMERS AND CUSTOMERS. THE PLATFORM HANDLES LOGISTICS AFTER ORDERS ARE RECEIVED, INCLUDING PROCESSING PAYMENTS, PLANNING DELIVERY, AND SETTING UP FARM-TO-CONSUMER TRANSPORTATION. IN ORDER TO FOSTER CONSUMER TRUST, THE PLATFORM GUARANTEES OPENNESS BY DISCLOSING INFORMATION ABOUT PRODUCT ORIGINS, AGRICULTURAL METHODS, AND PRICE DATA. THE PLATFORM'S PERFORMANCE IS CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED AND OPTIMIZED, WITH A FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE USER EXPERIENCE, SUPPLIER ONBOARDING PROCEDURES, AND LOGISTICS EFFECTIVENESS.\n","OUTPUT\n","PRODUCE THAT IS IN SEASON AND REASONABLY PRICED, STRAIGHT FROM FARMERS TO CUSTOMERS. INCREASED TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY CHAIN DUE TO CUSTOMER ACCESS TO INFORMATION REGARDING PRODUCT QUALITY AND PROVENANCE. FAIR PAY FOR FARMERS BECAUSE THE PLATFORM PUTS THEM IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH CUSTOMERS, CUTTING OUT INTERMEDIARIES. INCREASED CONVENIENCE FOR CONSUMERS THROUGH SEAMLESS ONLINE TRANSACTIONS, PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS, AND FLEXIBLE DELIVERY OPTIONS. INCREASED FOOD WASTE REDUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL OPTIMIZATION, LEADING TO INCREASED AGRICULTURE MARKET SUSTAINABILITY AND EFFICIENCY.\n"]}],"source":["filename = input('Enter filename: ')\n","try:\n","    basa = open(filename, 'r')\n","    for line in basa:\n","        print(line.upper().strip())\n","    basa.close()\n","except FileNotFoundError:\n","    print(f\"File '{filename}' not found.\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"IvDh-myfe7KH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713180366645,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":3174,"user":{"displayName":"YESHA DANE CABINGAN","userId":"10383898678221877968"}},"outputId":"50c61521-b04c-451b-9dbd-e8e33db10cc8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"c30769dc"},"source":["#### Exercise 2"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b0f6e6bd"},"source":["Write a program to read through a file and output the number of lines in a file.\n","\n","adapted from [PEW]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ca95da3b","outputId":"98c3a04b-2012-4875-fcb0-c7fc5459da3f","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713180210175,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":3227,"user":{"displayName":"YESHA DANE CABINGAN","userId":"10383898678221877968"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter filename: /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Workbook2/New Text Document.txt\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Workbook2/New Text Document.txt has 16 lines.\n"]}],"source":["filename = input('Enter filename: ')\n","count = 0\n","try:\n","    basa = open(filename, 'r')\n","    for line in basa:\n","        count += 1\n","    print('{} has {} lines.'.format(filename, count))\n","    basa.close()\n","except FileNotFoundError:\n","    print(f\"File '{filename}' not found.\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ceeb345a"},"source":["## CHALLENGE\n","\n","from [PEW] E8-2"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9a60e24f"},"source":["Write a program to prompt for a file name, and then read through the file and look for lines of the form:"]},{"cell_type":"raw","metadata":{"id":"0f31f487"},"source":["X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9cb1e131"},"source":["When you encounter a line that starts with \"X-DSPAM-Confidence:\" pull apart the line to extract the floating-point number on the line.
